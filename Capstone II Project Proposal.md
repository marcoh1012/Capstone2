## **Capstone II Project Proposal - 3D Printing  Model Site**

#### **Goal:**

​	**The purpose of this project is to improve the front-end of a very well known site named thingiverse.com. This site hosts 3D Models that you can download and print using 3D Printers. The main point to improve is the front page recommendations as it seems to have the same recommendations for a very long time and hope to mix it up some more. As well as in some recommendation pages if you click on a model and press the back button it will return to the first recommendation page instead of keeping track of what page you were on. **

#### Target Audience:

​	**The app is targeted for users with 3D printers that would like to download free 3d models to print. Particularly it targets users that would just like to browse different recommendations for ideas on what to print and not just the same recommendations every day. As well as making the site easier to use.**

#### Data:

​	**All data will be used from the Thingiverse API which will also allow users to upload/delete their own models.**

#### API:

​	**Thingiverse API: All model and user data will be from the API.**	

#### Summary:

​	**This is a front-end focused project using react/redux. Most of the sensitive information will be handled by the API so the project will only need to store the user token to log in. There might be some issues with the recommendation system as the sorting might need to be done in the front-end since the api does not have this implemented at the moment. The user flow will be very similar to the thingiverse site but the project is focused on a smoother and minimalistic front end user experience.**
